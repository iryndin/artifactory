#  Use this file to override system-level properties used by artifactory.     #
#  Artifactory-specific properties beginning with the "artifactory." prefix   #
#  will be handled internally by artifactory - you should change them only if #
#  you know what you are doing.                                               #
#  All other properties will become normal (jvm-wide) system properties, so   #
#  this file can be used as an alternative for specifying command-line        #
#  -Dparam=val parameters.                                                    #
