            <p>
                Artifactory system requirements:
                <ol>
                    <li>A valid
                        <b>JDK 1.5+</b>
                        installed on the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>At least 400m of Java heap size, for good management of the binary files.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    The downloadable artifactory zip install file contains an embedded Jetty container
                    with a with default Artifactory configuration for ultra easy startup.
                    After unzipping it, run the appropriate Windows or Linux script under the bin
                    directory.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>The bin folder also contains an install script for making artifactory
                a Linux service using chkconfig (RedHat and Suse).
            </p>
            <p>You can read the
                <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a>
                page for a description of artifactory folders.
            </p>
            <p>After installation the default admin user is username=admin and password=password</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Windows">
            <p>
                The file "artifactory.bat" under the bin folder, will look for java and run
                the main class.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="Linux">
            <p>The main dependency needed before running artifactory is to have a valid JDK 1.5+ on the machine.
                Before running scripts directly the JAVA_HOME should be set to a JDK 1.5+.
            </p>
            <p>The best to check the validity of your environment is to run "artifactoryctl check"
                under the bin folder. This script is a modification of jetty init script and is quite well
                documented.
            </p>
            <p>You can run artifactory with "artifactory.sh" directly to see its behavior.
                The console will be locked on artifactory process and you can stop it clean with CTRL+C.
            </p>
            <p>You can also try run directly "artifactoryctl check|start|stop" to run directly
                artifactory as a daemon process using the environment variable of the shell you are in.
            </p>
            <p>There is also under bin a script called "install.sh" that will run a bunch of
                unix commands to setup artifactory correctly as a Linux service.
            </p>
            <p>The install script is documented and you should look at it before running it.
                Anyway, here are the notes and informations about what this script is doing:

            <p>After running the script successfully you can test the installation by running:

            <p>And if everything OK start artifactory with:
