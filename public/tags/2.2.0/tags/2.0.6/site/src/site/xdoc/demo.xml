                <p>You can watch artifactory in action at:
                    <br/>
                    <a href="http://repo.jfrog.org/artifactory/webapp/">http://repo.jfrog.org/artifactory/webapp/</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a guest account:
                    <code>guest/guest</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This account is of course
                    limited, so in order to test drive the full thing just download and run it
                    locally with the default configuration.
                    <br/>
                    It's a matter of unzipping then click and run.
                    <br/>
