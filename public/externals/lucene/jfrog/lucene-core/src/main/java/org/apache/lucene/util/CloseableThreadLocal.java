/** Java's builtin ThreadLocal has a serious flaw:
 *  it can take an arbitrarily long amount of time to
 *  dereference the things you had stored in it, even once the
 *  ThreadLocal instance itself is no longer referenced.
 *  This is because there is single, master map stored for
 *  each thread, which all ThreadLocals share, and that
 *  master map only periodically purges "stale" entries.
 *
 *  While not technically a memory leak, because eventually
 *  the memory will be reclaimed, it can take a long time
 *  and you can easily hit OutOfMemoryError because from the
 *  GC's standpoint the stale entries are not reclaimaible.
 * 
 *  This class works around that, by only enrolling
 *  WeakReference values into the ThreadLocal, and
 *  separately holding a hard reference to each stored
 *  value.  When you call {@link #close}, these hard
 *  references are cleared and then GC is freely able to
 *  reclaim space by objects stored in it. */
