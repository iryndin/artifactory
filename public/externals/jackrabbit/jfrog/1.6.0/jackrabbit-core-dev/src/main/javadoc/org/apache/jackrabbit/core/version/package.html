<body>
The versioning framework in jackrabbit consists of 3 layers. A persistence layer,
an application layer and an presentation layer.<p>
The persistence layer uses a 'normal' workspace as storage. The storage can later
be exchanged by a more scaleable one. The application layer operates on the
persistent one and provides the internal view of the version storage. It is
manifested through the <code>InternalVersion</code> and
<code>InternalVersionHistory</code> objects. 
The internal versions are also mapped to the content and exposed through the
API (i.e. the <code>Version</code> extends <code>Node</code> and can be inspected
with normal Node methods). Furthermore the version store is also exposed below
<code>/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage</code>. The exact structure of it is not
defined yet, so applications should not relay on it and rather use
<code>Node.getVersionHistory()</code> to access a particular version history or
use the search mechanisms to find the respective versions.<p>
The presentation layer is managed by the <code>VersionManager</code>. it is
responsible for mapping the version storage to the content.
