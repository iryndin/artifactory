Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.2.8

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) 2.2, a fully compliant implementation of the
Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as
specified in the Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).

Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.8 is patch release that contains fixes and
improvements over previous 2.2.x releases. This release is backwards
compatible with all earlier 2.x releases.

Note that earlier 2.2.x releases (< 2.2.7) had a problem where very large
positive or negative long property values (more than 62 bits) could not be
correctly read from the reepository. The values are still correctly stored
in the reporistory, and can be properly read after upgrading to this release,
but any previous computations or other information derived from such
properties should be checked for correctness.
