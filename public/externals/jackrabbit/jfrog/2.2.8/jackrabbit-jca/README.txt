Welcome to Jackrabbit JCA Resource Adapter
==========================================

This is the JCA Resource Adapter component of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
This component packages the Jackrabbit content repository as a JCA 1.0 resource
adapter. The packaged adapter can be deployed on a wide range of application
servers. See the "deploy" directory for example deployment configurations.

The Jackrabbit content repository embedded in the JCA package is started when
first accessed and shut down when the adapter is un- or re-deployed.
