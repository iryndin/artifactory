This package contains classes and utilities used to build a WebDAV client
implementation.<br>
Currently it consists of DAV-specific extensions to the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/httpcomponents/httpclient-3.x/" target="_blank">Jakarta Commons HttpClient</a>,
namely a set of methods.
</p>

<p>
<h3>How to use Jakarta Commons HttpClient</h3>
Please refer to the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/httpcomponents/httpclient-3.x/tutorial.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
    present with Jakarta Commons HttpClient for detailed
instructions.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Simple Example</h4>
The following simple example illustrates the additional functionality exposed
    by the <strong>DavMethod</strong> which serves as basic interface for all
    WebDAV specific extensions:<br><br>

First you need to create the HostConfiguration which at least
    must define the uri pointing to your WebDAV enabled server
<pre>
    String uri = "http://your-webdav-server";
    HostConfiguration hostConfig = new HostConfiguration();
    hostConfig.setHost(uri);
</pre>

Define a HttpConnectionManager, which also is responsible
    for eventual multithreading support:
<pre>
    HttpConnectionManager connectionManager = new MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager();
    HttpConnectionManagerParams params = new HttpConnectionManagerParams();
    int maxHostConnections = 20;
    params.setMaxConnectionsPerHost(hostConfig, maxHostConnections);
    connectionManager.setParams(params);
</pre>

Create the HttpClient object and eventually pass the Credentials:
<pre>
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient(connectionManager);
    client.setHostConfiguration(hostConfig);
    Credentials creds = new UsernamePasswordCredentials("userId", "pw");
    client.getState().setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, creds);
</pre>

In order to execute a WebDAV request, choose the appropriate DavMethod.
    For example, a PROPFIND request could look as follows:
<pre>
    String propfindUri = "http://your-webdav-server/anyresource";
    DavMethod method = new PropFindMethod(propfindUri, DavConstants.PROPFIND_ALL_PROP, DavConstants.DEPTH_1);
    client.executeMethod(method);
</pre>

The DavMethod interface defines two methods that allows you to determine if the
    request was successfully executed without need to evaluate the status line and
    knowing about the required status codes:
    <ul>
        <li>DavMethod.checkSuccess()</li>
        <li>DavMethod.succeeded()</li>
    </ul>

<pre>
    method.checkSuccess();
</pre>

In case of success you can retrieve the response body in an appropriate formate
    and process it according to you needs,<br>
    For a PROPFIND request use e.g. DavMethod.getResponseBodyAsMultiStatus():
<pre>
    MultiStatus multiStatus = method.getResponseBodyAsMultiStatus();
</pre>
</p>
