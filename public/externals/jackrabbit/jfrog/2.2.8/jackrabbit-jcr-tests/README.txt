Welcome to Jackrabbit JCR Tests
===============================

This is the JCR Tests component of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
This component contains a set of JCR API test cases designed for
testing the compliance of an implementation. Note that although
this code base is used also for the official JCR TCK, this is not
the official TCK and passing the test of this component can not
be used as an indication of API compliance.
