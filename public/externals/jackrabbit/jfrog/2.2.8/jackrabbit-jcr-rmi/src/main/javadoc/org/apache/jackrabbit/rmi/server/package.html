Server implementation of the transparent JCR-RMI layer.
<p>
This package contains the default server implementation of the
transparent JCR-RMI layer. The classes in this package can be used
to make a local JCR repository available as an RMI service. In addition,
this package offers a straightforward mechanism for extending or modifying
the behaviour of the server layer.
<p>
The contents of this package is designed using two design patterns,
Factory and Adapter. All the remotely accessible ServerObject subclasses
implement the Adapter pattern to adapt a local JCR interface to the
corresponding remote JCR-RMI interface. The Factory pattern is used
to centralize the creation and configuration of all adapter instances.

<h2>Setting up a JCR-RMI server</h2>
<p>
Setting up the server part of the JCR-RMI layer is quite straightforward.
After instantiating a local JCR repository you need to wrap it into a
remote adapter and create an RMI binding for the repository. A variation
of the following code is usually all that is needed in addition to the
standard RMI setup (starting rmiregistry, etc.):

<pre>
    Repository repository = ...; // The local repository
    String name = ...; // The RMI URL for the repository
    
    RemoteAdapterFactory factory = new ServerAdapterFactory();
    RemoteRepository remote = factory.getRemoteRepository(repository);
    Naming.bind(name, remote);  // Make the RMI binding using java.rmi.Naming
</pre>

<h2>Extending the JCR-RMI server</h2>
<p>
The Factory pattern used by this package makes it easy to extend
the behaviour of the JCR-RMI server. Such changes in behaviour or policy
can be implemented by modifying or replacing the default
ServerAdapterFactory used in the example above.
<p>
The following example code adds transparent logging of all session logins
and logouts:

<pre>
    Repository repository = ...; // The local repository
    String name = ...; // The RMI URL for the repository
    
    RemoteAdapterFactory factory = new ServerAdapterFactory() {
        public RemoteSession getRemoteSession(Session session)
                throws RemoteException {
            System.out.println("LOGIN: " + session.getUserId());
            return new ServerSession(session, this) {
                public void logout() {
                    System.out.println("LOGOUT: " + session.getUserId());
                    super.logout();
                }
            };
        }
    };

    RemoteRepository remote = factory.getRemoteRepository(repository);
    Naming.bind(name, remote);  // Make the RMI binding using java.rmi.Naming
</pre>

</body>
