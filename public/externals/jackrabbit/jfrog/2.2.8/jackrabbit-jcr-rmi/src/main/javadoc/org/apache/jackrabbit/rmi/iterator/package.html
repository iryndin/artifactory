<body>
Utility classes for implementing JCR iterators based on static arrays.
<p>
This package contains array-based implementations of the JCR
{@link javax.jcr.RangeIterator RangeIterator} interfaces.
<p>
These utility classes were designed for the transparent JCR-RMI layer,
but can easily be used as a part of any JCR repository implementation.
This package depends only on the standard JCR and J2SE APIs.
