The repositories.zip file contains pre-generated Jackrabbit repositories
from past releases and configurations. If you make changes to the repository
content or add new versions, you can update the repositories.zip file by
running "mvn clean install" and using the resulting zip file from the
target directory to replace repositories.zip.
