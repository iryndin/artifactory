/**
 * The AccessControlProvider is used to provide access control policy and entry
 * objects that apply to an item in a single workspace. The provider is bound
 * to a system session in contrast to the <code>AccessControlManager</code> that
 * is bound to a specific session/subject.
 * <p/>
 * Please note following additional special conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The detection of access control policy/entries is an implementation
 * detail. They may be resource based or retrieved by other means.</li>
 * <li>An access control policy/entry may be inherited across the item hierarchy.
 * The details are left to the implementation</li>
 * <li>If no policy can be determined for a particular Item the implementation
 * must return some implementation specific default policy.</li>
 * <li>Transient (NEW) items created within a regular Session object are unknown
 * to and cannot be handled by the <code>AccessControlProvider</code>.</li>
 * <li>If the item id passed to the corresponding calls doesn't point to an
 * existing item, <code>ItemNotFoundException</code> will be thrown. It is
 * therefore recommended to evaluate the id of the closest not-new ancestor
 * node before calling any methods on the provider.</li>
 * <li>Changes to access control policy and entries made through the
 * <code>AccessControlEditor</code> are not effective unless
 * they are persisted by calling <code>Session.save()</code> on the session
 * that has been used to obtain the editor.</li>
 * </ul>
