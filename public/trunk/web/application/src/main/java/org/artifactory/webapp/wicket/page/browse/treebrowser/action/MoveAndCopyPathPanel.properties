targetPathCopy.help=Type the path in the target repository where the selected source should be copied to.\n\
NOTE: Copy operations are executed using Unix conventions (e.g.copying <i>org/jfrog/example</i> from\n\
a source repository to <i>org/jfrog/example</i> in a target repository will result in the contents of the source \n\
being copied to <i>org/jfrog/example/example</i>). To achieve the same path in the target repository, copy\n\
the source into one folder up in the hierarchy (i.e. copy source <i>org/jfrog/example</i> into target <i>org/jfrog</i>).\n\
If you leave the Target Path empty, the source will be moved into the target repository's root folder.
targetPathMove.help=Type the path in the target repository where the selected source should be moved to.\n\
NOTE: Move operations are executed using Unix conventions (e.g.moving <i>org/jfrog/example</i> from\n\
a source repository to <i>org/jfrog/example</i> in a target repository will result in the contents of the source \n\
being moved to <i>org/jfrog/example/example</i>). To achieve the same path in the target repository, move\n\
the source into one folder up in the hierarchy (i.e. move source <i>org/jfrog/example</i> into target <i>org/jfrog</i>).\n\
If you leave the Target Path empty, the source will be moved into the target repository's root folder.
