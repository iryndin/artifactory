                    Artifactory is a Maven 2 enterprise repository. It offers advanced proxying,
                    caching and security facilities to provide for a robust, reproducible and
                    independent build environment using Maven 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artifactory uses a JSR-170 compliant Java Content Repository (JCR) for storage,
                    which makes it extremely easy to manage fully indexed and searchable metadata
                    and to provide extended features such as security, transacted operations,
                    auditing, locking, etc.
