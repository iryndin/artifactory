                                by simply unpacking the downloadable archive and running the embedded Jetty container

                            <li>This removes your long-term dependency on Artifactory (all your artifacts
                                inside Artifactory Derby DB only), since you can stop using Artifactory
                                and use the backup or "dumped" folders as standard maven2 repository.

                            <li>The "dump", "restore" enables Artifactory upgrades even when the DB
                                schema changes.
