        <section name="Unzipping a new Version">
            <p>When a new version of Artifactory is delivered it contains
                again the whole installation zip/tgz.<br/>
                So, when unzipping a new verson, you need to keep the important
                subfolders of your Artifactory home:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <b>Folder Name</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <b>Description</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>etc</td>
                    <td>You need to keep your configuration files. Artifactory upgrades
                        that need configuration will be stated.<br/>
                        The best way on Unix is to have a link instead of this folder.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>logs</td>
                    <td>Keep or delete, you choose!
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>repos</td>
                    <td>Most upgrades don't change the DB schema, so just keep this folder
                        on the side during upgrades. The DB files are reused as they are.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>backup</td>
                    <td>Better keep them.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <section name="Changing just the war file">
            <p>
                Actually most Artifactory updates can be done by changing the artifactory.war.<br/>
                <b>ATTENTION:</b> Avoid hot-deploy as much as possible since jackrabbit/lucene and
                DerbyDB suffers during the process.
