            <p>The newer version of Artifactory contains again the whole installation zip/tgz.<br/>
                So, when unzipping a new verson, you need to keep the important
                subfolders of your Artifactory home:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <b>Folder Name</b>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <b>Description</b>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>etc</td>
                    <td>You need to keep your configuration files.<br/>
                        The best way on Unix is to have a sym link for this folder (created by the
                        default installation).
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>logs</td>
                    <td>Keep or delete, your choice.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>repos</td>
                    <td>You need to export your repositories and reimport them using the UI. After
                        you imported your repositories you can safely delete this folder as it no
                        longer exists in newer Artifactory releases.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                    <td>backup</td>
                    <td>Better keep.
                    </td>
                </tr>

            <p>
                Most minor Artifactory updates can be done by changing the artifactory.war file.<br/>
                <b>ATTENTION:</b> Avoid hot-deploy and make sure to delete the extracted artifactory
                folder under webapps/ before replacing the war.
